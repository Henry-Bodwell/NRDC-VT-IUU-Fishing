        "article_text": "Recently, during routine inspections of inbound express mail, Beijing Capital Airport Customs keenly captured a suspicious express mail through an X-ray machine. The image after the machine showed abnormal dense light spots. The staff immediately decided to unpack the express mail for inspection. It was found that the box was full of colorful and shiny\u00a0Oahu tree snail\u00a0shells. The customs department sent them to a professional organization for identification: this batch of shells totaled 2,292 pieces, all of which were shells of\u00a0Oahu tree snails\u00a0\u00a0(Achatinella spp.).\u00a0Oahu tree snails\u00a0are a rare snail that is only distributed on Oahu Island, Hawaii, also known as \u201cHawaiian tree snails\u201d. At present, the 41 known\u00a0Oahu tree snail\u00a0species in the world are all endangered or extinct. They have been listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and have been approved as national first-class protected animals. According to\u00a0China\u2019s \u00a0Customs Law and Regulations on the Import and Export of Endangered Wild Animals and Plants , any unit or individual who illegally imports, exports, carries or mails endangered wild animals and plants and their products without permission will be severely punished by law. This case once again sounded the alarm for us: not everything can be brought into the country. Protecting endangered species is the common responsibility of the whole society. Each of us should consciously resist the illegal trade of wildlife products and build a global community of life.
